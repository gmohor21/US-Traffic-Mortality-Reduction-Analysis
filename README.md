# US-Traffic-Mortality-Reduction-Analysis
Exploring and analyzing factors contributing to traffic mortality in the US, and proposing data-driven strategies to reduce the number of traffic-related fatalities.

# Project Description
While the rate of fatal road accidents has been decreasing steadily since the 80s, the past ten years have seen a stagnation in this reduction. Coupled with the increase in number of miles driven in the nation, the total number of traffic-related fatalities has now reached a ten-year high and is rapidly increasing.

By looking at the demographics of traï¬ƒc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan, we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?

Data wrangling, plotting, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering have been used for this project.
